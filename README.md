Project 1 for the Android Developer Nanodegree

This is the first project for the Android Developer Nanodegree course.
It's a simple app that queries TheMovieDB database and displays the most popular or highest voted movies.

### TheMovieDB API Key:

To run this app, you must have an API key:  
1. Navigate to [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and sign up for a key.  
2. Create a string resource in the project called `movie_api_key` and make your newly generated key the string resource value.
